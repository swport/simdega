                        It was the farsightedness of a few well educated visionaries of Simdega that this College was established in the year 1960 [the same year Ranchi University was established in Ranchi] in the S. S. High School premises of Simdega. People of Simdega generously donated money to meet the necessary expenditure. Government officials also extended full support. Thus the college started taking proper shape. A plot of land was donated by Sri Jagdish Prasad of Tukupani where the college building was constructed and was shifted in the present location within a very short time. The foundation of the main college building was laid by the then Governor of erstwhile Bihar state Hon'ble Sri Anant Shayanam Ayangaar. The College was affiliated to Ranchi University, Ranchi. </p>
                      
                    <p>The financial burden on the poor natives for college education abruptly came to a happy end as the nearest college at Ranchi was 170 Kms from this place. Dreams of the poor and needy were fulfilled. </p>
                    <p>Gradually, this private college of the people of Simdega achieved Grant-in- Aid status and in 1977 became a constituent unit of Ranchi University, Ranchi. Thereafter education up to Honours level started in almost all subjects. </p>
                      <p>Presently, this is the remotest college under Ranchi University which caters to the needs of people living in a very large area extending to the fringes of the state of Odissa and Chhattisgarh. </p>
                     <p>The hilly terrain of this area has no industry, no water resource. So, the agricultural products are negligible. Natives largely depend upon forest products. The existence of a degree college here is a great relief to them as they get a degree from here which is so essential in todayâ€™s world for a better living. In these fifty- eight years the college has made significant contribution to the society and continues to do so in every possible way. Compared to other places, considerable standard has also been maintained, so products of this college have gone far and wide and have been serving some of the highest echelons of the country. Nursing, armed forces and sports, particularly hockey, are some of the pockets where the students of this institution may be in abundance. Today a sizable number of the students come from economically weaker sections and are from ST, SC, BC categories with approx 80 % girls on our rolls. Thus this college has covered a very significant journey striving constantly to fulfill the dreams of especially, the tribal population of this locality.

                        The fundamental objective of this college is to make quality higher education accessible to those learners who remain deprived of it due to financial constraints. Its objective is to reach out to the most marginalized section of tribal society in particular. The college was founded with the noble objective of enlightening the first generation learners of this predominantly tribal community who were far away from the mainstream of national development.

                        Our vision is to produce ideal national and global citizens humanity may take pride in. In order to achieve this vision, we make every possible effort to ensure percolation of essence of higher education to the most downtrodden and marginalized section of society. We endeavour to provide quality education to the students that enables them to be competent and capable to face the challenges of life and society. Students are trained and equipped with positive thinking that help them become honest and useful social beings. We intend to impart such education which engenders among the young minds broad thinking that helps them assimilate traditional as well as modern values harmoniously.
